# Distributional Impact Analysis: Toolkit and Illustrations of Impacts Beyond the Average Treatment Effect

Program evaluations often focus on average treatment effects. However, average treatment effects miss important aspects of policy evaluation, such as the impact on inequality and whether treatment harms some individuals. A growing literature develops methods to evaluate such issues by examining the distributional impacts of programs and policies. This toolkit reviews methods to do so, focusing on their application to randomized control trials. This repository contains the programs to implement these methods and illustrates select methods using data from two randomized evaluations.

The toolkit emphasizes two strands of the literature: estimation of impacts on outcome distributions and estimation of the distribution of treatment impacts. We discuss extensions to conditional treatment effect heterogeneity, that is, to analyses of how treatment impacts vary with observed characteristics, offer advice on inference, testing, and power calculations, which are important when implementing distributional analyses in practice.
